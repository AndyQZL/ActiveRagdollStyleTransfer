## StyleTransfer001
* **Model:** U_Character_REFAvatar
* **Animation:** HumanoidWalk
* **Hypostheis:** Implement basic style transfer from mo-cap
* **Outcome:** In progress
  * U_Character_REFAvatar + HumanoidWalk has an issue whereby the feet collide. The RL does get learn to avoid - but it feels that this is slowing it down

  * **Raw Notes:**
  * Aug 27 2018: Migrate to new repro and tidy up code so to make open source
